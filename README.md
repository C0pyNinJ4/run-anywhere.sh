# run-anywhere.sh
Bash script which lets you run commands on multiple servers.

First you need to map your ip adress to the server name by doing:
echo '[ip-adress server-name]' >> /etc/hosts

Then you do: ssh-keygen
Press: 'Enter' a few times 
Then do: ssh-copy-id [server-name] 
Then write: 'yes' and press 'Enter'

Now you can start executing commands

But if you want to use another file for the server names then you can create a file with what ever server names you want and use the '-f' option
